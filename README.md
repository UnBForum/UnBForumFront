# UnBFórum

UnBFórum is an *online* discussion forum whose objective is to facilitate the search and sharing of academic information within the Faculdade do Gama (FGA) community.

To achieve this objective, the construction of the forum was guided by fundamental qualitative criteria for the creation of discussion forums. Furthermore, the application used Graph Theory to structure the relationship between topics and categories, through a bipartite graph.
